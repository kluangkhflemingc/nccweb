    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Initial problem statement was written in the perspective of the developer, not the user</li>
            <li>Scope was too large (not possible to fulfill in the allotted time)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Changed the wording and scope of the problem statement to better reflect the product of
                the web solution as opposed to the collaborative project</li>
            <li>Refined the scope to use pre-existing data for the same study area</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Begin researching web solution technology for the web application</li>

        <h2>Milestone 2: Getting Started with Configurable Applications</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Began experimenting with Experience Builder and StoryMaps as potential technology solutions</li>
            <li>Experience Builder was a steep learning curve with a tricky to use interface (ie. feature view widget overrides
                initial map view settings)
            </li>
            <li>StoryMaps didn't provide enough functionality and is optimized for multi-media and static content, which was not
                the focus of the solution
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Experience Builder contains a lot of useful functionality but requires a significant amount of time to learn</li>
            <li>Sometimes using a "workaround" is easier than trying to get the widget to work in the indended manner (such
                as manipulating the original data instead of recoding a custom widget)</li>
            <li>The choice of the solution is directly dependent on the goal of the project</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dedicated more time to learning Exprience Builder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Milestone 3.1: Development in ArcGIS Experience Builder</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Showing stream interconnectivity was difficult to do using the configurable widgets</li>
            <li>Group editing was not possible on Experience Builder (group members could not be editing the same Web Experience at once)</li>
            <li>Dynamic text is difficult to link to the appropriate data source</li>
            <li>Using views was difficult, but were required to overcome challenges of widgets re-setting initial view</li>
            <li>Difficulty in distinguishing format options between Maps, Views, and Pages</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Created multiple prototype proof-of-concept Experiences utilizing different widgets to display different properties
                of the data</li>
            <li>Possible to create a webpage-style application in Experience Builder</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Decide which approaches best fit the goals of the problem statement</li>

        <h2>Milestone 3.2: Download Developer Edition</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Downloading Developer Edition was time consuming and required the download of Node.js, ArcGIS Experience Builder
                Developer Package (requires running multiple programs from the Command Prompt)</li>
            <li>Every usage requires starting the client and server services from Command Prompt</li>
            <li>To authenticate the application, new credentials had to be created in a ArcGIS Developers account</li>
            <li>To make custom widgets it is necessary to learn TypeScript and React which are ESRI specific languages</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Getting ArcGIS Experience Builder Developer Edition started on a local computer is time-consuming
                (valuable time taken away from working on the actual project)</li>
            <li>The learning curve for create custom widgets is extremely high and should be avoided if possible</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Return to Experience Builder to focus on configuring the "off-the-shelf" widgets</li>

    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Meeting Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Recommended using ArcGIS Hub to create a website to embed the Experience Builder solutions and create a webpage-style application</li>
            <li>Encouraged the manipulation of data instead of configuring the widget</li>

        <h2>Milestone 4.2: Introduction to ArcGIS Hub</h2>
    <div class="section-style-1col">
        <h3 class="title-left">Challenges Encountered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Default template contained a lot of features that were not necessary (subtractive rather than additive templates)</li>
            <li>Challenging to change page formatting</li>
            <li>Easy to lose changes when switching to Preview Mode</li>
            <li>Difficult to find ArcGIS Hub in AGOL account as it creates a new folder upon creation</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Learning Outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ArcGIS Hub is a viable option for combining static and dynamic ESRI content (Web Maps, Experiences) in a 
                presentation-ready format</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title-left">Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Each group member created an ArcGIS Hub website to embed the Experiences</li>

            <li>One ArcGIS Hub was selected to embed the Experiences along with explanatory text and web maps to support the 
                problem statement</li>
