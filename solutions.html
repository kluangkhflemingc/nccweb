        <p class="section-style-1col">ArcGIS StoryMaps was investigated by Kathryn as a possible solution to accompany the ArcGIS 
            Experience Builder application. This was done in order to avoid some of the bugs that were being discovered while working 
            with Experience Builder. While working with StoryMaps, the biggest limitation that was noticed was the type of content 
            that can be included in the solution. StoryMaps seems to be an optimal way to share photo and video content along with 
            basic web maps and text content. StoryMaps also has the ability to embed html content, which was experimented with using 
            the NCC website, however lacks the functionality to do anything more technical. The group decided to not proceed with 
            StoryMaps any further past this point, deciding that the functionality of the web app should be prioritized. </p>

        <h2 id="exp-build">ArcGIS Experience Builder</h2>
        <p class="section-style-1col">Exploring Experience Builder, the team could quickly see that it was a viable option for our 
        intended outcome of an app that presents a dynamic map of our study area indicating headwaters and helping the user 
        trace downstream flow and connected stream segments.  Experience Builder is extremely powerful with many built-in 
        templates and widgets that can provide all sorts of functionality.  The drawback is that with all of these options, it 
        is fairly complex upon first approach.  The tools and the various ways they can be customized are not immediately intuitive.
        Consequently, the team explored multiple approaches to using Experience Builder.  We explored many different templates, and 
        learned how to use many of the available widgets.</p>
        <p class="section-style-1col">One piece of functionality we liked was the ability to have multiple pages in one experience.
            This gave us the opportunity to create an experience that looks like a website where the first page is a project 
            introduction (a "Home" page) and the second page is the actual application. This was done by embedding a previous application made in 
            Experience Builder into a new web experience. Below are some screen captures of our prototype web experiences.</p>

        <h2 id="exp-build-dev">ArcGIS Experience Builder Developer Edition</h2>
        <p class="section-style-1col">To explore the power of ArcGIS Experience Builder, ArcGIS Experience Builder Developer Edition was 
            installed on James and Kristine's computers. Since the server can be installed using a personal ArcGIS Developers 
            account, this offers a testing environment for custom development that is not connected to a larger 
            organization. Furthermore, experiences built with the Developer Edition will not disappear once a user 
            is no longer part of an organization. Drawbacks include having to start the client and server 
            every time you want to use the Developer Edition, inability to share an experience easily with external 
            users and having to learn TypeScript and React to create custom widgets. Therefore, if the client does 
            not have a requirement for custom development, there is no need to install ArcGIS Experience Builder 
            Developer Edition and ArcGIS Experience Builder will be able to meet all the project requirements.</p>

            <p class="section-style-1col">Installing the Experience Builder Developers Editions is no mean feat! The listed instructions
            breeze through certain specific steps, such as the need to go to the Developers account OAuth2.0 tab and reset the 
            redirect-URI to localhost:3001 in order to be able to connect with the actual development tool once everything has been installed.
            It requires download and install of Node.js which needs a system reboot.  And then after the download and install of the 
            primary package (ArcGISExperienceBuilder) it requires activation of the client and server components in Command Prompt, and then 
            these need to be turned on with the command prompt every time it is used.  As we were developing Experience options 
            for our collaborative project's dynamic map, it seemed that a custom widget may be require to search through the data and 
            select stream segments by NextDownIDs, and so we did explore the custom widget direction, but now are moving more in the 
            direction of restructuring the data in the final WebMap to fascilitate this functionality.</p>

        <p class="section-style-1col">While ArcGIS Experience Builder has the ability to create web applications that look like webpages (i.e. an experience
            can contain a page with all the front-end web design elements), the client did not specify that everything must be hosted in Experience Builder.
            A Hub Site was developed with ArcGIS Hub to create a web application that resembles a webpage with background information about the project and 
            study area. Advantages of Hub include more customization options available for the layout and seamless integration of ArcGIS applications like 
            web maps, web experiences and graphs.</p>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p class="section-style-1col">In the course of this exercise, we found the exploration of ESRI web development solutions very fruitful and enlightening.
        We had originally thought that StoryMaps might be a sufficient and easy pathway for developing a web aplication along the lines of our needs 
        for our collaborative project mapping headwaters, but eventually settled on a preference for the enhanced functionality of Experience Builder.
        Since our focus is not on data analysis, we determined dashboards would not add to what we are trying to accomplish, and we found WebApp Builder 
        to be basically a watered-down version of Experience Builder, and so we went with that.  Since our collaborative project client is familiar with, 
        and uses, ESRI products, we did not pursue open source options.  We now feel like we have a clear path forward to produce a high-quality dynamic 
        Web Map Application that will be valuable to our clients' conservation efforts, built in ESRI Experience Builder, with the ability to highlight and 
        immediately identify, headwater streams, and their interconnected hierarchy of down-stream flow. And creating a platform in Hub to document
        our process has shown that Hub is relatively easy to use and a good way to showcase other ESRI web applications organized with explanatory
        text and images.</p>
